It's maybe how my story ends

I'm not that ready, so to all my friends

And my Ma and Pa, God send them my goodbye

I've been on this ship for almost 13 months

People come and go and so much stories have been told

Now I miss my mom and I want to go home, but it's time for Masalembo

Six-meter wave's approaching

As everyone starts panicking, the seagull's rambling

I think that bird saw tampomas burned

History repeat itself, though this one is still a tragedy

I don't know why

Or how to get by

I'm not gonna lie

All faces look the same

I start to lose my mind

You don't have to be sad, it's a blessing

Some people fancy it as much as they're afraid of it

Those attention seekers, drama makers, and all the standard chasers

We have what they want and it's not even sin

What time is it? (Masalembo)

What time is it? (Masalembo)

What time is it? (Masalembo)

What time is it? (Masalembo)

What time is it? (Masalembo)

What time is it? (Masalembo)

What time is it? (Masalembo)

Ooh, it's showtime

I don't know why

Or how to get by

I'm not gonna lie

All faces look the same

They start to lose their minds

Oh, yeah!

Masalembo! Masalembo!

Masalembo! Masalembo!

Well, this is how my story ends

It's getting dark, but that's my proof of luck

I am so desperate that I am satisfied
